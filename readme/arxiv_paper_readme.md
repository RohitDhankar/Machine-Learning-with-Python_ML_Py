- Leo Dirac (@leopd) talks about how LSTM models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) have been practically replaced by transformer-based models.  Basic background on NLP, and a brief history of supervised learning techniques on documents, from bag of words, through vanilla RNNs and LSTM.  Then there's a technical deep dive into how Transformers work with multi-headed self-attention, and positional encoding.  Includes sample code for applying these ideas to real-world projects.

- ABSTRACT --    Transformers have achieved great success in many artificial intelligence fields, such as natural language
processing, computer vision, and audio processing. Therefore, it is natural to attract lots of interest from
academic and industry researchers. Up to the present, a great variety of Transformer variants (a.k.a. X-formers)
have been proposed, however, a systematic and comprehensive literature review on these Transformer variants
is still missing. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of various X-formers. We first briefly
introduce the vanilla Transformer and then propose a new taxonomy of X-formers. Next, we introduce the
various X-formers from three perspectives: architectural modification, pre-training, and applications. Finally,
we outline some potential directions for future research.
