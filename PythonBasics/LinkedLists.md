> Linked lists differ from lists in the way that they store elements in memory. While lists use a ```contiguous memory block``` to store references to their data, linked lists ```store references as part of their own elements.```

#
> A linked list is a collection of nodes. The ```first node``` is called the ```head```, and itâ€™s used as the starting point for any iteration through the list. The ```last node``` must have its next reference pointing to ```None``` to determine the end of the list.
